# Advent of Code 2020: F# 
I am using [2020's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge as an exercise to learn F#.
My solutions are unlikely to be highly optimised, but the algorithms used should be reasonable.
I use a functional style as much as is reasonably possible, aiming to write idiomatic F#.

## Pre-requisites
- Visual Studio 2019 with F# modules included.

## Building
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:jonnybolton/aoc2020-fsharp.git
   ```
2. Create an "input" directory inside the repo
   ```
   cd aoc2020-fsharp
   mkdir input
   ```
3. Download the puzzle input files from the Advent of Code website (https://adventofcode.com/2020) and place them inside the "input" directory. They should be named day01.txt, day02.txt, etc..
4. Open the visual studio solution aoc2020-fsharp.sln.
5. Build and run.
